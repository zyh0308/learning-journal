#### What is Markdown? ####
Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML.

Using Markdown is different than using a [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isnâ€™t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.
