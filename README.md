1. Growth Mindsets

Carol Dweck says
> ***In a growth mindset, people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work—brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment***

I think People who embrace growth mindsets-the belief that they can learn more or become smarter if they work hard and perserver,means may learn more, learn it more quickly. Also treat challenges and failures as opptiunites to improve their learning and skills.

> *This growth mindset is based on the belief that your basic qualities are things you can cultivate through your efforts. Although people may differ in every which way in their initial talents and aptitudes, interests, or temperaments, everyone can change and grow through application and experience.*

This is important because it can actually change what you strive for and what you see as success. By changing the definition, significance, and impact of failure, you change the deepest meaning of effort.

The following are 5 ways to remind myself to develop a growth mindset:
1. Acknowledge and embrace imperfections
2. View challenges as learning opptiunites
3. Value the process rather than end results
4. Try different learning methods.
