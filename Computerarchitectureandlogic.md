# Computer Architecture and Logic # 

- The four things common to use all computers:
INPUT 
STORE
PROCESSING 
OUTPUT

- Ones and zeros do play a big role in how computers works.

- Wires and circuts carry all the information in computer

- With more Bites you can represent more complex infromation 

- Binary system: 0 and 1

- 32 wires store from 0 to over 4 billion

- The computer does its primary work in a part of the machine we cannot see, a control center that converts data input to information output. This control center, called the central processing unit (CPU), is a highly complex, extensive set of electronic circuitry that executes stored program instructions. All computers, large and small, must have a central processing unit, the central processing unit consists of two parts: The control unit and the arithmetic/logic unit. Each part has a specific function.
