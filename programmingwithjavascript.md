# Programming with Javascript # 

1. ACCESS CONTENT
You can use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or text from an HTML page. For example:
• Select the text inside all of the <hl> elements on a page
• Select any elements that have a c1ass attribute with a value of note
• Find out what was entered into a text input whose id attribute has a value of email

2. MODIFY CONTENT
You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them. For example:
• Add a paragraph of text after the first <hl> element
• Change the value of c1ass attributes to trigger new CSS rules for those elements
• Change the size or position of an <img> element
  
3. PROGRAM RULES
You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page. For example:
• A gallery script could check which image a user clicked on and display a larger version of that image.
• A mortgage calculator could collect values from a form, perform a calculation, and display repayments.
• An animation could check the dimensions of the browser window and move an image to the bottom of the viewable area (also known as the viewport)

4. REACT TO EVENTS
You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred. For example, it could be run when:
• A button is pressed
• A link is clicked (or tapped) on
• A cursor hovers over an element
• Information is added to a form
• An interval of time has passed
• A web page has finished loading

- Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically.

- To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help).


#### Rules for naming variable ####
1. The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($),or an underscore (_). It must not start with a number.
2. The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_). Note that you must not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name.
3. You cannot use keywords or reserved words. Keywords
are special words that tell the interpreter to do something. For example, var is a keyword used to declare a variable. Reserved words are ones that may be used in a future version of JavaScript.

4. All variables are case sensitive, so score and Score would be different variable names, but it is bad practice to create two variables that have the same name using different cases.
5. Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores. For example, fi rstName might be used to store a person's first name,lastName for their last name, and age for their age.
6. If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word. For example, firstName rather than fi rstnarne (this is referred to as camel case). You can also use an underscore between each word (you cannot use a dash).

#### Basic Javascript instructions ####
- A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.
- Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.
- Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.
- Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.
- JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
- Expressions evaluate into a single value. 
- Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.
