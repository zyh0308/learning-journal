## Structure web page with HTML ## 

### Process and Design ###


#### Who? ####

Every website should be designed for the tarhet audience. It's important to understand who your target audience is. 

**Target audience: Individual**

- What is the age range of your target audience?
- Will your site appeal to more women or men? What is the mix? 
- Which country do your visitors live in?
- Do they live in urban or rural areas?
- What is the average income of visitors?
- What level of education do they have?
- What is their marital or family status?
- What is their occupation?
- How many hours do they work per week?
- How often do they use the web?
- What kind of device do they use to access the web?

**Target audience: Companies**

- What is the size of the company or relevant department?
- What is the position of people in the company who visit your site?
- Will visitors be using the site for themselves or for someone else?
- How large is the budget they control?


#### Why? ####

Why your audience are coming? Some of them just simily look around, but most of them will visit for a specific reason.

**Key Motivations**

-Are they looking for general entertainment or do they
need to achieve a specific
goal?
- If there is a specific goal, is it a personal or professional
one? on a product)?
- Do they see spending time on this activity as essential or a
luxury?

**Specific Goals**
- Do they want general information / research (such as background on a topic / company), or are they after something specific (such as a particular fact or information
- Are they looking for time sensitive information, such as the latest news or updates on a particular topic?
- Do they want to discover information about a specific product or service to help them decide whether to buy it or not?
- Do they need to contact you? If so, can they visit in person (which might require opening hours and a map)? Or might they need email or telephone contact details?


#### What ####

You don't need to list every reasons why someone visit you site, but you need to know key tasks and motivations. This informtion can help your site designs.

- Will visitors be familiar with your subject area / brand or do you need to introduce yourself?
- Will they be familiar with the product / service / information you are covering or do they need background information on it?
- What are the most important features of what you are offering?
- What is special about what you offer that differentiates you from other sites that offer something similar?
- Once people have achieved the goal that sent them to your site, are there common questions people ask about this subject area?


#### When ####

Some sites benefit from being updated more frequently than others. Some information (such as news) may be constantly changing, while other content remains relatively static.

- How often do the same people return to purchase from you?
- How often is your stock updated or your service changed?
- How often is the subject updated?
- What percentage of your visitors would return for regular updates on the subject, compared with those who will just need the information once?

#### Where ####

Since you know what needs to appear on your websit, you can start to organize your site.

- The aim is to create a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site. This is known as a **site map** and it will show how those pages can be grouped.
- To help you decide what information should go on each page, you can use a technique called **card sorting**.
- A **wireframe** is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.


#### How ####

-The primary aim of any kind of visual design is to communicate. Organizing and prioritizing information on a page helps users understand its importance and what order to read it in.
- **Visual hierarchy** refers to the order in which your eyes perceive what they see. It is created by adding **visual contrast** between the items being displayed. Items with higher contrast are recognized and processed first.
- When making sense of a design, we tend to organize visual elements into groups. Grouping related pieces of information together can make a design easier to comprehend. Here are some ways this can be achieved.
- Site navigation not only helps people find where they want to go, but also helps them understand what your site is about and how it is organized. Good navigation tends to follow these principles...


### HTML5 Layout ###

- Traditional HTML Layouts :  Web page authors used <div> elements to group together related elements on the page.
  - <div id="header">, <div id="nav">, <div id="content">...
- New HTML5 Layout: The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web page authors using them already
- Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.
- To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.
  
  
#### Extra Markup ####

- DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
- You can add comments to your code between the <!-- and --> markers.
- The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.
- The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
- <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
- The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.
- Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.
