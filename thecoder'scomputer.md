**Choosing a Text Editor**

"A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer." 

Some of the most important features of the text editor are: 1.) code completion; 2.) syntax highlighting; 3.) a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue); and 4.) the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them.

Every computer will come with its own text editor. On Mac computers, the text editor that comes with your computer is called, “Text Edit.” On Windows computers, the text editor that comes with your computer is called, “Notepad.” Since those text editors are already in your computer, it's easy to use and manage it. Usually, the text editors that come on your computer don’t have many features to speak of. They’re the barest bare bones text editors you’ll encounter.

A text editor can edit text, manage text and manage files. It wrangles your text together into something meaningful.
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.



**Cheat Sheet**

- **pwd** : Print Working Directory 

- **absolute** : Absolute paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to the root directory. You can identify them easily as they always begin with a forward slash ( / )


- **relative** : Relative paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to where we currently are in the system. They will not begin with a slash.


- **~ (tilde)** : This is a shortcut for your home directory. eg, if your home directory is /home/ryan then you could refer to the directory Documents with the path /home/ryan/Documents or ~/Documents

- **. (dot)** : This is a reference to your current directory. eg in the example above we referred to Documents on line 4 with a relative path. It could also be written as ./Documents (Normally this extra bit is not required but in later sections we will see where it comes in handy)

- **.. (dotdot)** : This is a reference to the parent directory. You can use this several times in a path to keep going up the hierarchy. eg if you were in the path /home/ryan you could run the command ls ../../ and this would do a listing of the root directory.

- **cd** : change directory, cd [location]

- **is** : List the contents of a directory

- **file** : obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is

- **ls -a** : List the contents of a directory, including hidden files

- **everything is a file under Linux** : everything is actually a file. A text file is a file, a directory is a file, your keyboard is a file (one that the system reads from only), your monitor is a file (one that the system writes to only) etc

- **Linux is an extensionless system** 

- **Linux is case sensitive**
